General Description:
Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of Docking Stations and bikes that anyone can use.
They want you to build a program that will run all the Docking Stations, simulate all the Bikes, and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff, and so on)
required to make their dream a reality. They call it - guess what? - 'Boris' Bikes, and they're offering a tasty sum of money.

This program will:

  .Run all the docking Stations
  .simulate all the bikes
  .emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff, and so on)
